krfb: cannot connect to X server
You should try:
Code:

krfb --display :0

and then connect to it, but dont forget to set the ~/.kde/share/config/krfbrc file with following content:

Quote:
[Invitations]
invitation_num=0

[Notification Messages]
systemtrayquitDesktop Sharing=false

[Security]
allowUninvitedConnections=true
askOnConnect=false
uninvitedConnectionPassword=<SetPasswordHere>

Then you can try to connect with:

Quote:
krdc localhost:10000
if you did a port forwarding like

Quote:
ssh -p22 -L10000:192.168.2.92:5900 sshUser@sampleSite.dyndns.org
